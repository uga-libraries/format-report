# Development Note
Plan to overhaul this script to automatically match the format identification information to NARA preservation risk data,
following the accessioning script https://github.com/uga-libraries/accessioning-scripts

# Purpose
 Aggregate and analyze CSV files with file format information generated by the UGA Libraries' digital preservation system (ARCHive) to identify the most common formats and monitor them for preservation risks.
 
 # Workflow
 Prior to running the scripts for the first time, install the Python pandas library.
 
 1. Download the format reports for each of the groups and the usage report (start of ARCHive - present) from the digital preservation system (ARCHive). Save the files to a single folder.
 
 2. Run the update standardization script to identify any formats that are not in the standardize_formats.csv, which is used to add format types and format standardized names to the format data to allow for easier analysis of trends. If any new formats are found, the script produces a file called new_formats.txt. Using the standardization guidelines, add the new formats to the standardize_formats.csv.
 
        python /path/update_standardization.py report_folder
 
 3. Run the merge format reports script to make two versions of CSVs that combine format information from all the group format reports and add standardized information. One CSV is organized by format and then by group. The other csv is organized by AIP and then by format.
 
        python /path/merge_format_reports.py report_folder
 
 4. Run the reports.py script to make an Excel workbook with analysis of the format data.
 
        python /path/reports.py report_folder
 
 5. Run the department_reports.py script to make an Excel workbook with analysis of each department's format data.
Can skip step 4 to only generate department reports.
