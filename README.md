# Purpose
 Aggregate and analyze CSV files with file format information generated by the UGA Libraries' digital preservation system (ARCHive) to identify the most common formats and monitor them for preservation risks.
 
# Workflow
 
1. Download the format reports for each of the groups and the usage report (start of ARCHive - present) from the digital preservation system (ARCHive). 
   Save the files to a single folder (report_folder).

 
2. Run the update standardization script to identify any formats that are not in the standardize_formats.csv, 
   which is used to add format types and format standardized names to the format data to allow for easier analysis of trends.

       python /path/update_standardization.py report_folder

 
3. If any new formats are found, the update standardization script produces a file called new_formats.txt. 
   Using the standardization guidelines, add the new formats to the standardize_formats.csv. 


3. Run the merge format reports script to make two versions of CSVs that combine format information from all the group format reports and adds standardized information and NARA risk information. 
   One CSV is organized by group and then by format. The other csv is organized by AIP and then by format.
 
       python /path/merge_format_reports.py report_folder nara_csv

 
4. Review the results of matching the format identifications to the NARA risk spreadsheet. 
   Remove extra matches, such as every version in NARA matching a singular format identification.
   Try to match additional format identifications to NARA.


5. Run the reports.py script to make an Excel workbook with analysis of the format data.

       python /path/archive_reports.py report_folder


6. Run the department_reports.py script to make an Excel workbook with analysis of each department's format data.
Can skip step 5 to only generate department reports.

       python path/department_reports.py archive_formats_by_aip_csv
