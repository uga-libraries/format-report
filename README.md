# format-report
 Aggregate and analyze csv files with file format information generated by the UGA Libraries' digital preservation system (ARCHive).
 
 # Workflow
 1. Download the format reports for all groups and the usage report (start of ARCHive - present) from the digital preservation system (ARCHive) and save everything into a single folder.
 
 2. Run the update_standardization.py script to identify any formats that are not in the standardize_formats.csv. If any are found, the script produces a file called new_formats.txt Add them to the CSV. If there were a lot to add, run update_standardization.py again to verify that none were missed.
 
 3. Run the csv_merge.py script to make a CSV that combines format information from all the group format reports and adds standardized information.
 
 4. Run the archive_capacity.py script to make a report with the total number of Collections, AIPs, and TBs in ARCHive overall and subdivided by group.
 
 5. Run the reports.py script to make a report with the total number of collections and AIPs subdivided by different criteria (combinations of ARCHive group, format type, and format standardized name).
