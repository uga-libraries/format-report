# Instructions for creating the ARCHive narrative report

## Overview and Purpose

Create a summary and visualizations of ARCHive format data.
It provides DCWG with an overview of our holdings and is a record of change to our holdings over time.
It is supplemented by department-specific reports with more detail. 

## Data Source

Use Excel and the data from the ARCHive Format Analysis spreadsheets to make charts and graphs of the data. 
Use the previous analysis' report as a template for the new report.

The spreadsheets will be in the Teams folder for this year's Format Analysis, in the "ARCHive Format Reports" folder. 
Save the narrative report here as well. 

## Formatting Guide

In all visualizations, use these guidelines for a more readable result.

- Titles
   - Bold
   - Black
   - Move the box closer to the image if there is too much white space.
   
- Font
   - Size 11
   - Black (if on white background) or white (if on a colored background)

- Crop the image after pasting it into the narrative report to remove extra white space.
