 # ARCHive Format Analysis Workflow
 
## Overview and Purpose
The Head of Digital Stewardship analyzes the formats in ARCHive every two years 
to monitor for preservation risks based on format.
The data is summarized across all our holdings and, starting in 2023, for each department.
The [NARA Digital Preservation Plan spreadsheet](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation) 
is used to assign risks to our formats.

## Data Gathering
Data is exported from ARCHive on or around November 1, at a time that no new content is being ingested into the system.

1. Create a folder in DCWG Teams [ARCHive > Format Analysis] named with the year for all documentation.
With the analysis year folder, make a folder named archive_reports_YYYY-MM-DD for the data.


2. From the Reports page in the ARCHive interface, download the File Formats report for every group,
except for Emory and Test AIP Group, and save them to the archive_reports folder.
It can take a long time to download, with DLG requiring multiple hours.


3. From the Reports page in the ARCHive interface, download the Usage report and save it to the archive_reports folder.
   - For the Start Date, click "Set to ARCHive start date"
   - For the End Date, use the date the file format reports were downloaded


4. From [NARA's GitHub](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation), 
download the CSV version of the most recent Digital_Preservation_Plan_Spreadsheet
and save it to the folder for this year's Format Analysis (but not in archive_reports). 


5. Download a copy of all the data to your local machine to run the scripts for the next steps.
