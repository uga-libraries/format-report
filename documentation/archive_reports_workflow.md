 # ARCHive Format Analysis Workflow
 
## Overview and Purpose
The Head of Digital Stewardship analyzes the formats in ARCHive every two years 
to monitor for preservation risks based on format.
The data is summarized across all our holdings and, starting in 2023, for each department.
The [NARA Digital Preservation Plan spreadsheet](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation) 
is used to assign risks to our formats.
